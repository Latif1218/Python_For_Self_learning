# input("what's your name? ")

# print("hello, latif")

## that is only prinf my name. not others 
## so what should i do to print any persons name?


# #___________________________________________________________________________

# # the solution is let's define variable as the name of (name)

# # ask user for their name

# name = input("what's your name? ")

# # say hello to user

# print("hello, "+ name)
# print("hello,",name)

# print("hello, ",end='')
# print(name)

## naw it's print any name




# name = input("what's your name? ")
# print(f"hello, {name}")






# name = input("what's your name? ")


# # Remove writespace from str
# name = name.strip()


# #Capitalize user's name 
# name = name.title()


# print(f"hello, {name}")





# name = input("what's your name? ").strip().title()
# print(f"hello, {name}")




# name = input("what's your name? ").strip().title()

# # split user's name into first name and last name
# first, last = name.split(" ")

# print(f"hello, {first}")






# function 
def hello(to):
    print("hello,", to)
    

name = input("What's your name? ")
hello(name)
